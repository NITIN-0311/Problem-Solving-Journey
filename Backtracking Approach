What is Backtracking ?

Backtracking is problem solving technique, that lets you to explore you multiple choices(subsets, windows) while maintaining the given condition. If the condition is violated it backtracks to the previous state and explore alternate way.

Where is backtracking useful?
  When your problem needs exploring different combinations of choices with given constraint
  Path based problems
  Permutations Problems and so on

Here is an example for better understanding. Let's say you have to choose the k number of toppings for your pizza in n sized menu.  

pizza_cmb(menu,k):
    options=[]
    current_menu=[]
    def cmb(current_menu,start):
        
        if len(current_menu)==k:
            options.append(current_menu[:])
            return ->Prune Branch
        
        for i in range(start,len(menu)):
            current_menu.append(menu[i])    
            cmb(current_menu,i+1)
            current_menu.pop() ->Backtrack
            
    cmb([],0)
    return options
    
pizza_cmb(["cheese", "corn", "paneer", "onion", "mushroom"],3)
Result:

['cheese', 'corn', 'paneer']
['cheese', 'corn', 'onion']
['cheese', 'corn', 'mushroom']
['cheese', 'paneer', 'onion']
['cheese', 'paneer', 'mushroom']
['cheese', 'onion', 'mushroom']
['corn', 'paneer', 'onion']
['corn', 'paneer', 'mushroom']
['corn', 'onion', 'mushroom']
['paneer', 'onion', 'mushroom'] 
Logical Template

FUNCTION Backtracking(input):

    result ← empty list
    path ← empty list

    FUNCTION backtrack(start):

            // 1. Base case
            Store explored result
            Return ->Pruning


            // 2.1 Choose
            APPEND input[i] TO path

            // 2.2 Explore deeper
            CALL backtrack(i + 1)

            // 2.3 Undo the choice (backtrack)
            REMOVE last element FROM path

    CALL backtrack(0)
    RETURN result
